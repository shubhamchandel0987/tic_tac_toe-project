This project is a digital implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, also known as Noughts and Crosses. It provides an interactive, engaging experience for players by leveraging programming logic and design principles.

Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple two-player game where each player alternates turns to place their mark (X or O) in a 3x3 grid. The objective is to achieve three consecutive marks in a row, column, or diagonal before the opponent. This project recreates the game with a clean user interface and robust functionality, making it both enjoyable and educational.
